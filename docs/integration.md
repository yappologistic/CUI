# Integration

`cui_app` is optional. The core of CUI is a pure library: you give it input and a viewport size, it gives you vertices. That makes it easy to put CUI inside a game engine, an existing app or a custom window, on any graphics API.

## The core loop

```c
#include <cui/cui.h>
#include <cui/cui_render.h>

cui_gl_renderer *gl = cui_gl_create(get_proc_address);          /* after your GL context is current */
cui_ctx *ui = cui_create(&(cui_ctx_desc){ .renderer = cui_gl_iface(gl) });

for (;;) {
    /* 1. forward input from your window system */
    cui_input_mouse_move(ui, mouse_x_points, mouse_y_points);
    cui_input_mouse_button(ui, CUI_MOUSE_LEFT, down);
    cui_input_scroll(ui, 0, wheel_lines);
    cui_input_key(ui, CUI_KEY_ENTER, pressed, mods);
    cui_input_text(ui, utf8_from_ime);

    /* 2. build the UI */
    cui_set_viewport(ui, width_points, height_points, pixels_per_point);
    cui_begin_frame(ui, seconds_since_last_frame);
    my_ui(ui);
    cui_end_frame(ui);

    /* 3. render */
    cui_gl_render(gl, cui_get_draw_data(ui), false);   /* false: draw over your scene */
    swap_buffers();

    /* 4. sleep until something happens (optional) */
    if (!cui_needs_redraw(ui)) wait_for_events(cui_next_wakeup(ui));   /* seconds, or -1 for no timer */
}
```

Coordinates are in points (logical pixels). `pixels_per_point` is 2 on a typical retina screen. Input events can arrive at any time between frames; CUI collects them for the next frame.

### Input reference

| Function | Notes |
|---|---|
| `cui_input_mouse_move(ui, x, y)` | Points, relative to the viewport |
| `cui_input_mouse_button(ui, button, down)` | `CUI_MOUSE_LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `MIDDLE` |
| `cui_input_mouse_leave(ui)` | The pointer left the window |
| `cui_input_scroll(ui, dx, dy)` | In lines. Positive `dy` is the wheel moving up, toward the top of the content. Trackpads: pixels / 44 |
| `cui_input_key(ui, key, down, mods)` | `CUI_KEY_*` and `CUI_MOD_SHIFT`, `CTRL`, `ALT`, `SUPER`. Send key repeats as additional presses |
| `cui_input_text(ui, utf8)` | Typed characters after keyboard layout and IME processing |
| `cui_input_focus(ui, focused)` | Window focus changes |

### Platform services

```c
cui_set_platform(ui, &(cui_platform_iface){
    .user = my_window,
    .set_clipboard = my_set_clipboard,           /* (void *user, const char *utf8) */
    .get_clipboard = my_get_clipboard,           /* returns a string valid until the next call */
    .set_cursor = my_set_cursor,                 /* CUI_CURSOR_ARROW, HAND, TEXT, RESIZE_EW... */
    .set_text_input_rect = my_set_ime_rect,      /* where the IME candidate window should go */
});
```

Useful queries for your app: `cui_wants_keyboard` (a text field has focus), `cui_wants_mouse` (the pointer is over the UI), `cui_get_cursor`.

## Using the built-in backends with your loop

The SDL2 and GLFW backends are complete `cui_app` implementations (`-DCUI_PLATFORM=sdl2` or `glfw`). Read `src/platform/cui_app_sdl2.c` for a compact, real example of the integration above: about 250 lines including the key map.

## Renderers

### OpenGL

`cui_gl_create(loader)` works with OpenGL 3.3 core and OpenGL ES 3.0 contexts (detected automatically). No GL headers or loader library are needed; pass `SDL_GL_GetProcAddress`, `glfwGetProcAddress`, `wglGetProcAddress` or similar. It returns NULL when the context is too old.

`cui_gl_render` sets its own blend, scissor and viewport state and leaves depth testing and face culling off. Restore your state afterwards if your renderer relies on it.

### Software

```c
cui_sw_renderer *sw = cui_sw_create();
cui_ctx *ui = cui_create(&(cui_ctx_desc){ .renderer = cui_sw_iface(sw) });
...
cui_sw_render(sw, cui_get_draw_data(ui), pixels, width, height, stride_bytes, CUI_SW_BGRA);
```

Renders into any 32 bit buffer, using several threads. Output matches the GPU renderer to within a fraction of a percent. Great for servers, tests, thumbnails and embedded framebuffers. `cui_write_png` saves a buffer.

### Your own renderer

You need two things:

1. **Textures.** Implement the three callbacks in `cui_renderer_iface`: create (R8 for the font atlas, RGBA8 for images), update a sub-rectangle, destroy. Return any nonzero handle.
2. **One draw call per command.** For each `cui_draw_cmd` set the scissor rectangle to `clip` (pixels, top left origin), bind `texture` (0 means `font_atlas`) and draw `index_count` indices starting at `index_offset` as triangles. Blend with premultiplied alpha: `src * 1 + dst * (1 - src_alpha)`.

The vertex format and the reference shader are in [rendering.md](rendering.md). Porting them to Vulkan, Metal, Direct3D 11/12, WebGPU, sokol or bgfx is mostly syntax.

## Threads

A `cui_ctx` is not thread safe; use it from one thread. You may create several contexts (for several windows) and use each from its own thread. The software renderer parallelizes internally.

## Memory

All allocations go through `cui_ctx_desc.allocator` if you provide one. Per frame data lives in an arena that is reused, so a steady UI does not allocate. Component state is freed automatically a few seconds after the component disappears.

## Binary size

CUI is built to stay small. Measured with GCC, `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel`, stripped, x86-64:

| | Size |
|---|---|
| Whole library (every component, both renderers, X11 backend, fonts) | about 590 KB |
| of which embedded fonts (Inter, Geist, Geist Mono, 168 Lucide icons) | 95 KB, compressed |
| `examples/hello` on Linux, whole executable | about 240 KB |
| `examples/hello.exe` on Windows (MinGW), whole executable | about 380 KB |
| `examples/assistant`, an AI chat app | about 330 KB |
| `examples/gallery`, every component in use | about 690 KB |

What keeps it small:

- The library is compiled with one section per function, so the linker can drop everything your app never calls. Turn that on in your own executable for release builds: `-Wl,--gc-sections` (GCC and Clang on Linux, MinGW), `-Wl,-dead_strip` (macOS), `/OPT:REF /OPT:ICF` (MSVC). The examples already do.
- The embedded fonts are stored as DEFLATE streams (about 48% smaller) and unpacked into memory once, when a context is created (about 1.5 ms).
- Image decoding covers PNG and JPEG only. `-DCUI_IMAGE_ALL_FORMATS=ON` adds BMP, GIF and TGA.

Going smaller:

| Option | Saves |
|---|---|
| `-DCUI_DEFAULT_FONTS=OFF` (load your own fonts with `cui_font_load_file`) | 95 KB plus the decoder |
| `-DCUI_STB_IMAGE=OFF` (upload pixels yourself with `cui_image_create`) | about 24 KB |
| `-DCUI_WITH_APP=OFF` (core only, for use inside your engine) | the window layer and dialogs |

## Optional Arabic-script text shaping

Configure with `-DCUI_TEXT_SHAPING=ON` to enable experimental static
Arabic-script shaping and Unicode bidi. It is off by default. The draw and measure
paths share the shaped advances; labels, headings, buttons and `cui_text` need no
API changes. Load a trusted Arabic-script font, such as Vazirmatn, and assign it to
a font role or add it as a fallback. The embedded Latin fonts do not cover Persian.

Text inherits its resolved context/container direction. Explicit RTL/LTR set the
paragraph base. AUTO finds the first strong character and neutral containers inherit.
Direct drawing uses the context direction; AUTO/INHERIT use first-strong, default LTR.
See [reading direction](layout.md#reading-direction).
CUI resolves the Unicode embedding levels and visual run order. CUI's internal
`cui_shape.c` reads OpenType substitutions and positioning directly from the loaded
font bytes, including lam-alef, ZWNJ and ZWJ. It needs no additional library. Only
strings containing RTL characters or bidi/join controls enter this path. Latin-only
strings keep the original iterator, rasterization and optical tracking. Shaped
strings use the font's natural advances without optical tracking, which would
otherwise pull cursive joins apart.

Text fields keep their existing drawing, cursor and selection behavior. This option
does not add RTL editing or IME. Shaped paragraphs wrap greedily
at spaces using complete shaped candidate-line advances. They retain their
paragraph levels and use UAX #9 line ordering for each resulting line. The Latin
path retains its existing heading balancing and orphan adjustment. An overlong
shaped word stays whole, like the browser's default overflow behavior. RTL ellipsis
truncation remains experimental.

The C99 bidi implementation has no runtime dependency or allocator. It implements
P2/P3, W1-W7, N0-N2 (including bracket pairing), I1/I2, L1/L2 and L4 character
mirroring from UAX #9. Explicit embeddings, overrides and isolates are unsupported
and treated as boundary neutrals. CUI substitutes mirrored characters before shaping.
The internal `cui_bidi.h` separates paragraph resolution from line ordering: resolve
the paragraph once, then order each line range without changing paragraph levels.
The wrapper resolves each paragraph once and reuses those levels for every line.
A context retains up to 64 paragraphs in least-recently-used order and up to 128
shaped line ranges per paragraph. Cached glyph positions are shared by measurement
and drawing; loading fonts or changing font roles/fallbacks invalidates them. Atlas
resets and viewport scale changes keep glyph positions in logical units valid.
Each retained text also keeps its completed wrapping result for the most recent
font, size and width, so repeated frames skip candidate-line measurements.
Multiline measurement returns the widest newline-separated paragraph.

Unicode 17.0.0 tables are checked in. To regenerate, download
`extracted/DerivedBidiClass.txt`, `BidiBrackets.txt` and `BidiMirroring.txt` from
`https://www.unicode.org/Public/17.0.0/ucd/` into a scratch UCD directory, then run
`python tools/gen_bidi.py UCD_DIRECTORY src/cui_bidi_data.h`.
The data files are not bundled. `cui_bidi_conformance BidiCharacterTest.txt` runs
the separately downloaded Unicode 17 character tests, excluding cases containing
explicit embeddings, overrides or isolates; levels and visual order must both match.
`cui_test_bidi` checks paragraph context across line ranges, L1/L2 and mirroring.

The internal shaper and bidi sources compile only with this option. Shaping buffers
use the CUI allocator. Font loading requires trusted fonts because stb_truetype
does not validate untrusted downloaded font data. Script segmentation covers
Arabic, Hebrew and Latin; other script tags currently fall back to Latin.

The internal shaper implements Arabic joining, canonical Arabic composition and
mark ordering, GSUB single/multiple/alternate/ligature/context/chained-context/
extension lookups, and GPOS single/pair/mark-to-base/mark-to-ligature/mark-to-mark/
context/chained-context/extension lookups. It uses the font's default language
system. It does not implement variable-font positioning, device corrections,
cursive attachment, reverse-chained substitutions or Arabic presentation-form
fallback for fonts without OpenType Arabic features. Context and ligature rules
are limited to 256 input glyphs. This remains an experimental subset of OpenType,
not a claim of general HarfBuzz equivalence.

Regenerate the Unicode 17.0.0 tables with `python tools/generate_joining.py`.
The script downloads Unicode data for generation; the data files are not vendored.
For the test-only HarfBuzz oracle, install `uharfbuzz` in an isolated Python
environment, build `cui_shape_dump`, then run:

```sh
python tools/compare_shape.py build/tests/Release/cui_shape_dump.exe path/to/Vazirmatn-Regular.ttf path/to/tahoma.ttf --output shape-results.json
python tools/check_shape_size.py build-off/examples/Release/hello.exe build-on/examples/Release/hello.exe
python tools/test_shape_size.py
```

MSVC x64 Release `hello.exe` must stay within 46,080 bytes of the fixed upstream
OFF reference (282,112 bytes), so ON must not exceed 328,192 bytes. The size
command prints both actual sizes and exits unsuccessfully above this ceiling.
The fixed upstream reference is never replaced by the current OFF size.

The 220-line Persian corpus matches HarfBuzz 15.0.0 glyph IDs, advances and offsets
with Vazirmatn Regular and Windows Tahoma. With the additional 441 mark-pair cases
(`--marks`), all 661 glyph sequences match for both fonts. Tahoma positions match
on all 661; six Vazirmatn cases differ by one font unit in one mark's horizontal
offset. Exact positioning equivalence is therefore not yet achieved.

With tests enabled, `cui_rtl` is a headless visual probe. Pass an external trusted
Vazirmatn-Regular.ttf and output PNG path. It checks lam-alef advance reduction,
ZWNJ's effect, fallback measurement and the Persian glyphs in a mixed-script
label. It renders Persian, mixed text, digits, punctuation and a wrapped paragraph:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCUI_TEXT_SHAPING=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
build/tests/Release/cui_rtl path/to/Vazirmatn-Regular.ttf rtl.png
```

The font is not bundled. The ordinary CTest suite needs no external font.

`cui_rtl_paragraph FONT.ttf OUT_PREFIX` checks forced-container direction and shaped wrapping and captures the
mixed Persian paragraph at 240, 360 and 600 px. Append `bench` for 200 measured
build/layout/draw-list frames after 30 warm-up frames, excluding rasterization.
It also benchmarks two copies joined into one 156-word Persian paragraph.
It fails if either Persian average exceeds 0.25 ms. This measures cached steady-state
frames, not cold-frame latency. Add any fourth argument to `cui_rtl` for dark images.

The following fixture is rendered by `cui_rtl` with shaping OFF and ON:

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Light | ![Unshaped Persian](images/rtl/text-before-light.png) | ![Shaped Persian](images/rtl/text-after-light.png) |
| Dark | ![Unshaped Persian](images/rtl/text-before-dark.png) | ![Shaped Persian](images/rtl/text-after-dark.png) |
