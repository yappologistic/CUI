# Integration

`cui_app` is optional. The core of CUI is a pure library: you give it input and a viewport size, it gives you vertices. That makes it easy to put CUI inside a game engine, an existing app or a custom window, on any graphics API.

## The core loop

```c
#include <cui/cui.h>
#include <cui/cui_render.h>

cui_gl_renderer *gl = cui_gl_create(get_proc_address);          /* after your GL context is current */
cui_ctx *ui = cui_create(&(cui_ctx_desc){ .renderer = cui_gl_iface(gl) });

for (;;) {
    /* 1. forward input from your window system */
    cui_input_mouse_move(ui, mouse_x_points, mouse_y_points);
    cui_input_mouse_button(ui, CUI_MOUSE_LEFT, down);
    cui_input_scroll(ui, 0, wheel_lines);
    cui_input_key(ui, CUI_KEY_ENTER, pressed, mods);
    cui_input_text(ui, utf8_from_ime);

    /* 2. build the UI */
    cui_set_viewport(ui, width_points, height_points, pixels_per_point);
    cui_begin_frame(ui, seconds_since_last_frame);
    my_ui(ui);
    cui_end_frame(ui);

    /* 3. render */
    cui_gl_render(gl, cui_get_draw_data(ui), false);   /* false: draw over your scene */
    swap_buffers();

    /* 4. sleep until something happens (optional) */
    if (!cui_needs_redraw(ui)) wait_for_events(cui_next_wakeup(ui));   /* seconds, or -1 for no timer */
}
```

Coordinates are in points (logical pixels). `pixels_per_point` is 2 on a typical retina screen. Input events can arrive at any time between frames; CUI collects them for the next frame.

An idle CUI app costs nothing: with no input and nothing animating, `cui_needs_redraw` is false and the loop sleeps. Components that blink or wait (the caret, tooltips, toasts) set `cui_next_wakeup`. When your own content changes on a timer, such as a clock, a poll or messages arriving, call `cui_request_wakeup(ui, seconds)` during the frame. The loop then wakes for it instead of redrawing continuously. `cui_request_redraw` asks for the next frame right away, for things that change every frame.

### Input reference

| Function | Notes |
|---|---|
| `cui_input_mouse_move(ui, x, y)` | Points, relative to the viewport |
| `cui_input_mouse_button(ui, button, down)` | `CUI_MOUSE_LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `MIDDLE` |
| `cui_input_mouse_leave(ui)` | The pointer left the window |
| `cui_input_scroll(ui, dx, dy)` | In lines. Positive `dy` is the wheel moving up, toward the top of the content. Trackpads: pixels / 44 |
| `cui_input_key(ui, key, down, mods)` | `CUI_KEY_*` and `CUI_MOD_SHIFT`, `CTRL`, `ALT`, `SUPER`. Send key repeats as additional presses |
| `cui_input_text(ui, utf8)` | Typed characters after keyboard layout and IME processing |
| `cui_input_focus(ui, focused)` | Window focus changes |

### Platform services

```c
cui_set_platform(ui, &(cui_platform_iface){
    .user = my_window,
    .set_clipboard = my_set_clipboard,           /* (void *user, const char *utf8) */
    .get_clipboard = my_get_clipboard,           /* returns a string valid until the next call */
    .set_cursor = my_set_cursor,                 /* CUI_CURSOR_ARROW, HAND, TEXT, RESIZE_EW... */
    .set_text_input_rect = my_set_ime_rect,      /* where the IME candidate window should go */
});
```

Useful queries for your app: `cui_wants_keyboard` (a text field has focus), `cui_wants_mouse` (the pointer is over the UI), `cui_get_cursor`.

## Using the built-in backends with your loop

The SDL2 and GLFW backends are complete `cui_app` implementations (`-DCUI_PLATFORM=sdl2` or `glfw`). Read `src/platform/cui_app_sdl2.c` for a compact, real example of the integration above: about 250 lines including the key map.

## Renderers

### OpenGL

`cui_gl_create(loader)` works with OpenGL 3.3 core and OpenGL ES 3.0 contexts (detected automatically). No GL headers or loader library are needed; pass `SDL_GL_GetProcAddress`, `glfwGetProcAddress`, `wglGetProcAddress` or similar. It returns NULL when the context is too old.

`cui_gl_render` sets its own blend, scissor and viewport state and leaves depth testing and face culling off. Restore your state afterwards if your renderer relies on it.

### Software

```c
cui_sw_renderer *sw = cui_sw_create();
cui_ctx *ui = cui_create(&(cui_ctx_desc){ .renderer = cui_sw_iface(sw) });
...
cui_sw_render(sw, cui_get_draw_data(ui), pixels, width, height, stride_bytes, CUI_SW_BGRA);
```

Renders into any 32 bit buffer, using several threads. Output matches the GPU renderer to within a fraction of a percent. Great for servers, tests, thumbnails and embedded framebuffers. `cui_write_png` saves a buffer.

### Your own renderer

You need two things:

1. **Textures.** Implement the three callbacks in `cui_renderer_iface`: create (R8 for the font atlas, RGBA8 for images), update a sub-rectangle, destroy. Return any nonzero handle.
2. **One draw call per command.** For each `cui_draw_cmd` set the scissor rectangle to `clip` (pixels, top left origin), bind `texture` (0 means `font_atlas`) and draw `index_count` indices starting at `index_offset` as triangles. Blend with premultiplied alpha: `src * 1 + dst * (1 - src_alpha)`.

The vertex format and the reference shader are in [rendering.md](rendering.md). Porting them to Vulkan, Metal, Direct3D 11/12, WebGPU, sokol or bgfx is mostly syntax.

## Threads

A `cui_ctx` is not thread safe; use it from one thread. You may create several contexts (for several windows) and use each from its own thread. The software renderer parallelizes internally.

## Memory

All allocations go through `cui_ctx_desc.allocator` if you provide one. Per frame data lives in an arena that is reused, so a steady UI does not allocate. Component state is freed automatically a few seconds after the component disappears.

### What a window costs

Most of what a process uses with the OpenGL renderer belongs to the graphics driver, not to CUI. Measured with `examples/hello` and `examples/tracker` (Release build, 6 seconds after start, three runs each, the same within 2%):

| | `hello`, resident (private) | `tracker`, resident (private) |
|---|---|---|
| Linux, software renderer | 7.1 MB (4.5 MB) | 12.6 MB (9.9 MB) |
| Linux, OpenGL (Mesa llvmpipe) | 100 MB (59 MB) | 108 MB (63 MB) |
| Linux, a bare OpenGL 3.3 window that only clears, no CUI | 76 MB (33 MB) | |
| Windows 10, OpenGL (NVIDIA), reported in issue #9 | 66 MB (111 MB) | 74 MB (126 MB) |
| Windows 10, software renderer, same report | | 19 MB (11 MB) |

The Linux machine has no GPU, so its OpenGL is Mesa's CPU rasterizer; on it CUI picks the software renderer by itself unless told otherwise (see [Performance](performance.md)). The bare window shows the driver's own cost before anything is drawn. The rest of the OpenGL figure is mostly the driver compiling and keeping CUI's shader. CUI's part is small:

- the context, its state and buffers, with the five embedded fonts unpacked (about 180 KB): 1.6 to 2.3 MB for the example apps after an hour of use ([Performance](performance.md));
- the glyph atlas, 1 MB at first. It doubles as needed, up to 16 MB with very large or many text sizes, and compacts back when the text is gone;
- with OpenGL, one shader program, one copy of the atlas as an 8-bit texture (1 MB at first) and a vertex buffer the size of a frame's triangles (usually under 1 MB).

CUI keeps the CPU copy of the atlas because it grows and compacts the atlas there and the software renderer draws from it. That is 1 MB at first, small next to the driver.

Pick the software renderer (`.renderer = CUI_RENDERER_SOFTWARE` in `cui_app_desc`, or `CUI_RENDERER=software`) when memory matters more than GPU offload: tools that stay open all day, many windows, small machines. It redraws only the tiles that changed, so a steady app costs almost no CPU; [Performance](performance.md) has the numbers. Keep OpenGL for large, busy windows on machines with a real GPU.

## Binary size

CUI is built to stay small. Measured with GCC, `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel`, stripped, x86-64:

| | Size |
|---|---|
| Whole library (about 190 components, both renderers, X11 backend, fonts) | about 1,050 KB |
| of which embedded fonts (Inter, Geist, Geist Mono, 168 Lucide icons) | 95 KB, compressed |
| `examples/hello` on Linux, whole executable | about 250 KB |
| `examples/hello.exe` on Windows (MinGW, linked with `-flto`), whole executable | about 300 KB |
| `examples/assistant`, an AI chat app | about 350 KB |
| `examples/gallery`, every component in use | about 1,010 KB |

What keeps it small:

- The library is compiled with one section per function, so the linker can drop everything your app never calls. Turn that on in your own executable for release builds: `-Wl,--gc-sections` (GCC and Clang on Linux), `-Wl,-dead_strip` (macOS), `/OPT:REF /OPT:ICF` (MSVC). The examples already do.
- **MinGW:** its linker cannot drop single functions (every function has an unwind record, and it keeps them all), so it keeps whole files. Release builds of CUI also carry link-time optimization data, so link your app with `-flto` (or set `CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION`) and only what you call remains: `assistant.exe` is 420 KB that way and 740 KB without. Without `-flto` everything still links and works, only bigger.
- Release builds on Linux and BSD leave out unwind tables (6 to 7% of an app; CUI is C and throws nothing). `-DCUI_KEEP_UNWIND_TABLES=ON` keeps them, for backtraces from release builds or C++ exceptions thrown through CUI callbacks.
- The embedded fonts are stored as DEFLATE streams (about 48% smaller) and unpacked into memory once, when a context is created (about 1.5 ms).
- Parts only some apps use (color emoji, the file browser, the terminal, the image decoder) are reached only from their own components; the core never calls into those files directly, so even a linker that keeps whole files leaves them out of an app that does not use them.
- Image decoding covers PNG and JPEG only. `-DCUI_IMAGE_ALL_FORMATS=ON` adds BMP, GIF and TGA.

Going smaller:

| Option | Saves |
|---|---|
| `-DCUI_DEFAULT_FONTS=OFF` (load your own fonts with `cui_font_load_file`) | 95 KB plus the decoder |
| `-DCUI_STB_IMAGE=OFF` (upload pixels yourself with `cui_image_create`) | about 24 KB |
| `-DCUI_WITH_APP=OFF` (core only, for use inside your engine) | the window layer and dialogs |

## From C++

The headers are `extern "C"` and compile as C++11 or later, so CUI links into a C++ program like any C library. One thing differs: the named-argument calls (`cui_button(ui, "Save", .variant = ...)`) and the block macros (`cui_column(ui) { ... }`) are C99 and are not defined in C++. Call the function behind each one instead: the `_ex` function with an options struct, and the `_begin` and `_end` pair.

```cpp
#include <cui/cui.h>
#include <cui/cui_app.h>

static void frame(cui_ctx *ui, void *) {
    cui_box page{};
    page.pad = 24;
    page.gap = 12;
    cui_column_begin(ui, &page);
    cui_heading(ui, "Welcome", 2);
    static bool notify = true;
    cui_switch_ex(ui, "Email me when a build fails", &notify, nullptr);
    cui_button_opts save{};
    save.variant = CUI_BUTTON_PRIMARY;
    if (cui_button_ex(ui, "Save", &save)) { /* ... */ }
    cui_box_end(ui);
}

int main() {
    cui_app_desc desc{};
    desc.title = "My app";
    return cui_app_run(&desc, frame, nullptr);
}
```

Pass `nullptr` for the options to take every default. With C++20 the struct can be written in place, close to the C form: `cui_button_opts save{ .variant = CUI_BUTTON_PRIMARY };` (fields in the order the header declares them; GCC's `-Wextra` then warns about the fields you left out, which `-Wno-missing-field-initializers` turns off). Every component's page on the site names its `_ex` function and lists the struct's fields. CUI's own tests compile this example as C++ on every push (`tests/cpp_compat.cpp`).

## Text in other languages

The date components show month and weekday names and a "Today" button. Give CUI a table to show them in another language; it keeps the pointer and reads it every frame, so switching language is one call, and passing `NULL` goes back to English. An entry you leave `NULL` stays English. Weeks start on Monday, as in every CUI calendar.

```c
static const cui_strings es = {
    .month = { "enero", "febrero", "marzo", "abril", "mayo", "junio", "julio",
               "agosto", "septiembre", "octubre", "noviembre", "diciembre" },
    .month_short = { "ene", "feb", "mar", "abr", "may", "jun", "jul", "ago", "sept", "oct", "nov", "dic" },
    .weekday = { "lunes", "martes", "miércoles", "jueves", "viernes", "sábado", "domingo" },
    .weekday_short = { "lun", "mar", "mié", "jue", "vie", "sáb", "dom" },
    .weekday_min = { "lu", "ma", "mi", "ju", "vi", "sá", "do" },
    .today = "Hoy",
};
cui_set_strings(ui, &es);
```

The date picker, date range picker, calendar, month and week calendars, gantt, calendar heatmap and file browser read the table. A component option that names its own words (the month calendar's `month_names`, the tour's button labels) wins over it. The order of day, month and year in a date stays the English one for now, and the date range picker's preset names ("Last 7 days") are not in the table yet. The English names live in one small file that only these components link, so an app without them pays nothing.

## Optional Arabic-script text shaping

Configure with `-DCUI_TEXT_SHAPING=ON` to enable experimental static
Arabic-script shaping and Unicode bidi. It is off by default. The draw and measure
paths share the shaped advances; labels, headings, buttons and `cui_text` need no
API changes. Load a trusted Arabic-script font, such as Vazirmatn, and assign it to
a font role or add it as a fallback. The embedded Latin fonts do not cover Persian.

Text inherits its resolved context/container direction. Explicit RTL/LTR set the
paragraph base. AUTO finds the first strong character and neutral containers inherit.
Direct drawing uses the context direction; AUTO/INHERIT use first-strong, default LTR.
See [reading direction](layout.md#reading-direction).
CUI resolves the Unicode embedding levels and visual run order. CUI's internal
`cui_shape.c` reads OpenType substitutions and positioning directly from the loaded
font bytes, including lam-alef, ZWNJ and ZWJ. It needs no additional library. Only
strings containing RTL characters or bidi/join controls enter this path. Latin-only
strings keep the original iterator, rasterization and optical tracking. Shaped
strings use the font's natural advances without optical tracking, which would
otherwise pull cursive joins apart.

A single-line text field (`cui_input`, `cui_search`, `cui_number`) edits right-to-left
and mixed text by reading order. Its direction is the container's when that is
right-to-left, otherwise the first strong letter of the text, and left to right when
there is none, as in a browser's `<input dir=auto>`. Right-to-left text starts at the
right edge: the first Persian letter typed into an empty field moves it there, and an
empty field in a right-to-left container has its caret on the right.

- Left and Right follow the reading order, not the screen: in a right-to-left field
  Left moves forward and Right moves back. With a selection and no Shift they collapse
  it to its start or end the same way. Home and End go to the start and end of the text.
- The caret moves by character together with the marks and joiners after it (ZWNJ, ZWJ,
  Arabic marks, Hebrew points, combining marks). Inside a lam-alef ligature it stops
  between the lam and the alef. Where the text changes direction it sits at the edge of
  the neighbour with the lower bidi level, as in a browser.
- Delete removes the character with its marks and joiners. Backspace removes one code
  point, as in a browser.
- A direction mark (LRM, RLM) takes no room: the caret before and after it is at one
  place, as in a browser. A zero-width space between a Latin and an Arabic letter still
  differs: a browser puts the caret after it at the far edge of the Arabic letter.
- A selection is drawn as one box for each run of the line, so a selection across a
  change of direction can be two boxes. A click puts the caret at the nearest caret
  position. Long text scrolls from the start edge of the line and keeps the caret inside.

Not covered: `cui_textarea`, masked password fields, the code editor, word jumps by visual
order (Ctrl and Cmd with the arrows keep the old word rule, in the reading direction),
changes to the undo history, IME composition, screen readers and dragging selected text.
Latin-only text, also in a right-to-left container, keeps its earlier drawing and stays
at the left. Shaped paragraphs wrap greedily
at spaces using complete shaped candidate-line advances. They retain their
paragraph levels and use UAX #9 line ordering for each resulting line. The Latin
path retains its existing heading balancing and orphan adjustment. An overlong
shaped word stays whole, like the browser's default overflow behavior. RTL ellipsis
truncation remains experimental.

The C99 bidi implementation has no runtime dependency or allocator. It implements
P2/P3, W1-W7, N0-N2 (including bracket pairing), I1/I2, L1/L2 and L4 character
mirroring from UAX #9. Explicit embeddings, overrides and isolates are unsupported
and treated as boundary neutrals. CUI substitutes mirrored characters before shaping.
The internal `cui_bidi.h` separates paragraph resolution from line ordering: resolve
the paragraph once, then order each line range without changing paragraph levels.
The wrapper resolves each paragraph once and reuses those levels for every line.
A context retains up to 64 paragraphs in least-recently-used order and up to 128
shaped line ranges per paragraph. Cached glyph positions are shared by measurement
and drawing; loading fonts or changing font roles/fallbacks invalidates them. Atlas
resets and viewport scale changes keep glyph positions in logical units valid.
Each retained text also keeps its completed wrapping result for the most recent
font, size and width, so repeated frames skip candidate-line measurements.
Multiline measurement returns the widest newline-separated paragraph.

Unicode 17.0.0 tables are checked in. To regenerate, download
`extracted/DerivedBidiClass.txt`, `BidiBrackets.txt` and `BidiMirroring.txt` from
`https://www.unicode.org/Public/17.0.0/ucd/` into a scratch UCD directory, then run
`python tools/gen_bidi.py UCD_DIRECTORY src/cui_bidi_data.h`.
The data files are not bundled. `cui_bidi_conformance BidiCharacterTest.txt` runs
the separately downloaded Unicode 17 character tests, excluding cases containing
explicit embeddings, overrides or isolates; levels and visual order must both match.
`cui_test_bidi` checks paragraph context across line ranges, L1/L2 and mirroring.

The internal shaper and bidi sources compile only with this option. Shaping buffers
use the CUI allocator. Font loading requires trusted fonts because stb_truetype
does not validate untrusted downloaded font data. Script segmentation covers
Arabic, Hebrew and Latin; other script tags currently fall back to Latin.

The internal shaper implements Arabic joining, canonical Arabic composition and
mark ordering, GSUB single/multiple/alternate/ligature/context/chained-context/
extension lookups, and GPOS single/pair/mark-to-base/mark-to-ligature/mark-to-mark/
context/chained-context/extension lookups. It uses the font's default language
system. It does not implement variable-font positioning, device corrections,
cursive attachment, reverse-chained substitutions or Arabic presentation-form
fallback for fonts without OpenType Arabic features. Context and ligature rules
are limited to 256 input glyphs. This remains an experimental subset of OpenType,
not a claim of general HarfBuzz equivalence.

Regenerate the Unicode 17.0.0 tables with `python tools/generate_joining.py`.
The script downloads Unicode data for generation; the data files are not vendored.
For the test-only HarfBuzz oracle, install `uharfbuzz` in an isolated Python
environment, build `cui_shape_dump`, then run:

```sh
python tools/compare_shape.py build/tests/Release/cui_shape_dump.exe path/to/Vazirmatn-Regular.ttf path/to/tahoma.ttf --output shape-results.json
python tools/check_shape_size.py build-off/examples/Release/hello.exe build-on/examples/Release/hello.exe
python tools/test_shape_size.py
```

MSVC x64 Release `hello.exe` must stay within 46,080 bytes of the fixed upstream
OFF reference (282,112 bytes), so ON must not exceed 328,192 bytes. The size
command prints both actual sizes and exits unsuccessfully above this ceiling.
The fixed upstream reference is never replaced by the current OFF size.

The 220-line Persian corpus matches HarfBuzz 15.0.0 glyph IDs, advances and offsets
with Vazirmatn Regular and Windows Tahoma. With the additional 441 mark-pair cases
(`--marks`), all 661 glyph sequences match for both fonts. Tahoma positions match
on all 661; six Vazirmatn cases differ by one font unit in one mark's horizontal
offset. Exact positioning equivalence is therefore not yet achieved.

With tests enabled, `cui_rtl` is a headless visual probe. Pass an external trusted
Vazirmatn-Regular.ttf and output PNG path. It checks lam-alef advance reduction,
ZWNJ's effect, fallback measurement and the Persian glyphs in a mixed-script
label. It renders Persian, mixed text, digits, punctuation and a wrapped paragraph:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCUI_TEXT_SHAPING=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
build/tests/Release/cui_rtl path/to/Vazirmatn-Regular.ttf rtl.png
```

The font is not bundled. The ordinary CTest suite needs no external font.

`cui_rtl_paragraph FONT.ttf OUT_PREFIX` checks forced-container direction and shaped wrapping and captures the
mixed Persian paragraph at 240, 360 and 600 px. Append `bench` for 200 measured
build/layout/draw-list frames after 30 warm-up frames, excluding rasterization.
It also benchmarks two copies joined into one 156-word Persian paragraph.
It fails if either Persian average exceeds 0.25 ms. This measures cached steady-state
frames, not cold-frame latency. Add any fourth argument to `cui_rtl` for dark images.

The following fixture is rendered by `cui_rtl` with shaping OFF and ON:

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Light | ![Unshaped Persian](images/rtl/text-before-light.png) | ![Shaped Persian](images/rtl/text-after-light.png) |
| Dark | ![Unshaped Persian](images/rtl/text-before-dark.png) | ![Shaped Persian](images/rtl/text-after-dark.png) |
